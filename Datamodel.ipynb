    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Outline the limitations of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting:\n",
    "The large gap between training accuracy (~94%) and test accuracy (~67%) suggests the model overfits the training data and struggles to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Generalization:\n",
    "The performance drop on the test set indicates the model may not fully capture the underlying patterns or is sensitive to noise or variations in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Imbalance:\n",
    "Some classes have lower recall or precision, possibly due to imbalanced class distribution, making it harder for the model to predict minority classes accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Interaction Constraints:\n",
    "Decision trees split on single features at a time, which might miss complex interactions between multiple features impacting student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "Outline any trade-offs of your model, such as any circumstances where the model exhibits performance issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bias vs. Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "A deeper tree (max depth = 15) reduces bias by fitting training data closely but increases variance, causing overfitting and poor generalisation to new data (as seen in the test set accuracy drop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shallower trees reduce overfitting but may underfit, missing important patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability vs. Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deeper trees are less interpretable because of many splits, making it harder to extract simple, actionable rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler trees are easier to understand but might not capture nuanced relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling of Class Imbalance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model may perform well on majority classes but struggle with minority classes, leading to uneven precision and recall across classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: \n",
    "\n",
    "Another model such as random forest might have been better at classification but that would have meant a sacrifice in the interpretation which was a trade-off I was not willing to do in this case. Interpretability was more important. "
